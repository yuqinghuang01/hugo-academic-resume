I am a final year undergraduate student double-majoring in Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am particularly interested in image segmentation and 3D reconstruction.
In Fall 2021, I was an undergraduate research assistant advised by Prof. [Olga Veksler](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~oveksler/).

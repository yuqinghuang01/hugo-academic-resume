abstract: We study two classes of summary-based cardinality estimators that use statistics about input relations and small-size joins in the context of graph database management systems. (i) optimistic estimators that make uniformity and conditional independence assumptions; and (ii) the recent pessimistic estimators that use information theoretic linear programs.

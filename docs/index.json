It does not rely on item attributes or user characteristics, as content-based approaches do. Collaborative filtering is widely employed in various applications, such as suggesting movies, products, or music to users based on their past preferences and behaviour. This paper presents a comprehensive review of collaborative filtering methods for building recommendation systems. Bayesian Factorization Machines (BFM) outperform other methods significantly. Ensembling predictions of models with similar performances proves beneficial. Further, modifications to ALS show promising results. The incorporation of bias parameters in the ALS factorization model improves performance directly. Additionally, we show promising results for the use of deep sigmoid factorization if able to be paired with ALS optimization. Including the item count of the user in the feature vector enhances generalization for BFM","tags":[],"title":"Collaborative Filtering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarper Ertekin","Orhun G√∂rkem","Yuqing Huang","Laura Roduner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686528000,"objectID":"f5c3e533e8162b8e877e6bdc1d547e94","permalink":"https://yuqinghuang01.github.io/publication/example2/","publishdate":"2023-06-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/example2/","section":"publication","summary":"This project results from ETH‚Äôs and CustomSurg‚Äôs joint interest and collaboration in terms of 3D Vision with HoloLens and is realized over a span of 3 months as part of the lecture 3D Vision.

In this paper, we study a framework called *cardinality estimation graphs* (CEGs) that allows us to connect two disparate lines of work on optimistic and pessimistic estimators, adopt an optimization from pessimistic estimators to optimistic ones, and provide insights into the pessimistic estimators, such as showing that there are alternative combinatorial solutions to the linear programs that define them.","tags":[],"title":"Accurate Summary-based Cardinality Estimation Through the Lens of Cardinality Estimation Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuqing Huang","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
